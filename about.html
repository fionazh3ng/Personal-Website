    <h2>Owning a cat</h2>
    <p>Owning a cat can be an extremely rewarding relationship. A cat has the ability to both calm your nervous system and provide an immediate outlet for fun and play. Although cats are independent animals who like to scavenge and explore on their own terms, they are also very affectionate with their owners and people they trust.</p>
    <p>I adopted a 4 months old orange tabby kitten in 2016 and named her Fifi. Fast forward 8 years, she's been my best friend, my emotional support and has taught me how to love unconditionally. I might adopt another one in the future.</p>

    <h2>Travel to new places</h2>
      <p>Traveling has been one of my top priorities for a very long time. I make a concerted effort to travel as much as I can throughout the year even while maintaining my full time job. </p>
      <p>Travel simplifies things, and the effect is enhanced when you're alone â€“ the onus is on you to make the trip work. You untether yourself from the stress and obligations associated with people who know you, and blitz the brain fog that may well cloud your everyday life.</p>
      <p>The most memorable trip so far is the solo trip to Thailand in 2022 for my 30th birthday!</p>

    <h2>Being a minimalist</h2>
    <p>When you live as a minimalist, you strive to only use things that serve a purpose. It's about living simply and having only what you need to go about your daily life. The bare necessities approach of minimalism can help people keep their living space stress-free, taking away a big chunk of anxiety and work they previously worried about. This also relieves brain space to pursue other activities that are more enjoyable than straightening up one's house.</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite books about the minimalism are "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" by Marie Kondo, and "Goodbye, Things: The New Japanese Minimalism" by Fumio Sasaki. Highly recommend!</p>
